# Food Share App - UI

### The App

Now that we have the back end part of the Food Share App implemented we will
start working on the front end (or UI). We will implement CRUD operations and
check the front end perspective.

### Tools Used

There are quite a big number of tools involved when creating a front end project.

#### NodeJS

Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that
that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.

We won't be using NodeJS per se, but we will use the package manager which comes
bundled with NodeJS. The name of the package manager is `npm`.
